                                                <p>To open HUD press <span style="font-weight:bold">CTRL+B</span>. HUD is active only when cursor is showing (it will hide in crosshair mode). The main feature of the tool is creating groups and transforming them. To create one press <span style="font-weight:bold">G</span> to start selecting and select few elements – it doesn’t have to be an object, tool supports all popular element types including race. To unselect press the same element again (you can find more detailed info about selecting in next paragraph). If done, press <span style="font-weight:bold">G</span> again to approve selection – all red elements should become green. Another way of selecting – hold <span style="font-weight:bold">G</span>, select few elements and release the button. After that group will be created automatically (it is good and faster when you want to select only few elements). Now you can freely move and rotate the group as an one big element. Controls are the same like in map editor – <span style="font-weight:bold">CTRL + arrow</span> to rate, arrow to move, <span style="font-weight:bold">SHIFT</span> to make it faster, <span style="font-weight:bold">CTRL</span> to make it slowly. If you want to clone the group press <span style="font-weight:bold">C</span> or press a clone icon (in shape of 2 rectangles). Similarly you can destroy it by pressing <span style="font-weight:bold">X</span> or an icon on the left side of the clone icon. This action changes all IDs of group elements. To keep old IDs press <span style="font-weight:bold">CTRL+X</span> or disable changing IDs in settings. New IDs are helpful mostly in detecting old groups. You can undo or redo actions by pressing a proper arrow icon.

                                                <p>There are 4 types of selecting – you can switch between them by pressing one of icons in selection options (second row in main HUD). Changing selection type while selecting won’t cancel selection. If you don’t know how to start selecting read basics first. Before I introduce them it is a good moment to mention about selecting large groups. You can select elements as many as you want but it is obvious that if you create large groups (you are able to select even whole maps) it will cause lags. You can deal with them or use a feature which hides most of elements in the group and reduce lags. It is worth a try. How it works? Select many elements and you will receive a notification “You selected many elements and its editing may cause lags. Do you want to create this group anyway?” – select 3rd option: “Yes, but show only few elements while editing”. You will be asked to select few elements you want to see. Try to avoid many rotation transformations (rotating around different axes many times) otherwise final calculations will take much time. Keep in mind that changing pivot position, covering, cloning and duplicate options don't work in this case. If you selected elements and didn’t receive the notification change “Minimum elements for large group” option in settings and set lower value. You should save map before creating large groups.

                                                <p>Wand is really useful and the most complicated feature in comparison to other selection types. Actually there are 3 selection options in 1. First of all it detects old groups and elements created by the tool, just press <b>G</b> and select 1 one of these elements to select a whole group. Another option is selecting nearby elements with the same type or model. By default it selects all objects outlying 50 meters from the object you selected. You can change the distance in wand options. Third wand feature is loop detection - it detects loops and duplications. All you have to do is select first 2-3 objects and wand will select the rest. When you select for example every 3rd object of the loop wand will proceed the same way. Keep in mind that if all 3 selection option are enabled wand will select all nearby elements. To avoid it you have to press <b>CTRL</b> while selecting or just disable nearby elements detector in wand options. Watch tutorial in case you have doubts how it works. You know how to fast select many elements but how to unselect them? You can use either undo option or press <b>SHIFT</b> and click on selected element – it will work analogous to selecting. If you want to unselect only 1 element press <b>CTRL + SHIFT</b> and click on selected element.

Another thing you should know but also should be obvious – it selects only elements which are streamed in so you won’t select elements which are far away, out of sight.

                                                <p>Pivot is a middle point of a group (3 perpendicular lines). All group elements are being rotated around this point. It might be useful in some cases especially in cloning and duplicating (examples in video tutorial). You can change pivot position using editboxes or arrows near editboxes (when you press <b>CTRL</b> and press an arrow it will deacrease value jump and <b>SHIFT</b>  gives the opposite effect). ‘Get’ button allows you to get position of any element, so when you press the button and then select an element, pivot position will be the same as position of the element. ‘Reset’ changes pivot position to default values. You can switch between absolute and relative position (absolute position in the middle point is 0,0,0 and relative position gets real GTA position), it is useful when you change values manually. </p>

Select few elements (optionally create a group) and press ‘Get’ button. Do the same with another group and press the second ‘Get’ button. Define number of duplications and press GO. If you select Between option tool will generate duplications between these 2 groups. Pivot position is very important because pivots of 2 groups determinate direction of duplication (video explains it well).

                                                <p>To open library press the book icon. Library allows you to store various groups and load them whenever you want. To add a group to library press save icon (blue floppy disk), then define its name and choose category. You can sort your groups in browser by element count or by name, just press a proper header on the top of the browser. When your library becomes big it may be easier to search groups. Type part of group name and press search (magnifying glass icon). You can search not only by name but also by category and map name (map name only if groups are imported from a map). You are able to import all MSTU groups from a map – just press ‘Import from map’, select the map you want and define name and category. To load a group select it in browser and press green folder icon.  If you want to see preview of library groups press grey eye icon. Move around with camera using <b>LMB</b>. Use mouse scroll to zoom in / out (<b>LCTRL</b> – slower zooming, <b>SHIFT</b> – faster zooming). To remove group from library select it in browser and press red bin icon. And to remove imported groups from a map press ‘Remove from map’. You can also remove all your groups by pressing ‘Clear local library’. You can switch between Global and Local – first option shows all groups and local shows group created by you.

                                        <p>Cover is a powerful tool which enables you to cover elements very fast. Press brick icon to open its HUD. Press ‘Create new setting’. You will see preview of an object. You can change its model in editbox (Covered model). Preview works exactly like library preview. Move around with camera using <b>LMB</b>. Use mouse scroll to zoom in / out (<b>CTRL</b> – slower zooming, <b>SHIFT</b> – faster zooming). Additionally you can change weather or disable lines which help you recognize sides.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>As you can see there are 5 rows representing each side of the object. You can set model, position and rotation. When you define a valid model you should see this object in preview. Edit position and rotation using editboxes or arrows near editboxes (when you press <b>CTRL</b> and press an arrow it will deacrease value jump and SHIFT  gives the opposite effect). Attention: editing rotation sometimes might be problematic and when you change rotation for example from 89 degrees to 91, an object can rotate by 180 degrees – you have to either search alternative rotation or use values such as 90.0001). If you don’t want to use all sides leave model empty or disable it (switch this side to X). ‘C’ buttons clear rows (set values to default). You can change scale, collisions or make objects doublesided – it concerns only elements you create, not the main cover element! Press ‘Save’ if done. Now you use this setting in covering. Create a group which contains objects with model you used while designing cover setting. Important:  in case you select various elements, cover tool detects dominating model to be covered. If you did everything correctly you should see preview of your cover (if you don’t see try to hide cover HUD and open again, optionally restart tool or create the setting again). If you change position or roation of the group preview of the cover won’t change so you have to press yellow button ‘Update’ before you appove it. You can disable sides of the setting or if you made many settings for 1 model you can use arrows to search other model for covering. You can also type it manually if you know what model you want to use. If you want to use the same model for all sides you can type it on the top and press 'Set' to apply it to all editboxes.

So as I mentioned you can have many settings for 1 model. Each time you create new setting all models of the setting will be set as default (after creating a group you will see preview of this setting).

                                        <p>I said you can change scale, collisions and make objects doublesided but what if I want to apply it only to few objects of the cover setting? Well, you have to create 2 different settings, if you want to combine them type in editboxes proper models or change default settings.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>With this feature you can cover objects very fast but also create any compositions and apply them to loops, roads and wherever you want. Watch video tutorial to see examples.

					     	<h4>Version 1.1</h4>
						<!--//section-block-->
						<div id="update1"  class="section-block">
							<li>Added GUI themes</li>
							<li>Added Raytrace for 2D selection</li>
							<div class="section-block">Raytrace is a new option for 2D (rectangular) selection which selects elements only in your sight of view (skipping elements behind other elements). This option might be much more useful, just keep in mind this method uses 9 (or only 1 if crossing is disabled) characteristic points of each element and it doesn't work perfect in some cases. You can always toggle raytrace in settings (It's called "Raytrace for 2D selection", if it is selected it will be enabled as default) or using a key (which can be changed in settings as well, 'R' is default key), you can use the key no matter if this option is enabled or disabled.
							</div>
							<li>Added axes lock</li>
							<div class="section-block">This option allows you to move groups along XYZ axes. It works similar to editor axes lock but in this case you can toggle this option both in tool settings and using a key ('Q' is default key).
							</div>
							<li>Added ped different alpha when selected</li>
							<li>Info about tool in chatbox is more clear, added command /mstu to open HUD, shared welcome_message.lua file where you can edit / remove this message.</li>
							<li>Fixed marker alpha doesn't change after group destroy</li>
							<li>Improved drawing bounding box for race pickups and spawnpoints</li>

					<div id="update1"  class="section-block">
					     	<h4>Version 1.2</h4>
						<!--//section-block-->
						<div id="update2"  class="section-block">

							<li>Added mirror tool. It allows to mirror groups or single elements around X, Y or Z axis. It has few options:</li>
							<ul>
							<li>Changing distance between mirror and original elements</li>
							<li>Ruler which checks distance between 2 surfaces. Might be useful in setting distance between original and mirror elements but also in mapping overall.</li>
							<li>Reset position and show / hide green surface which determinates mirror's position</li>
							<li>Auto update and update button to see preview of mirrored elements</li>
							<li>Enable / disable adding collisions and mirror shader</li>
							<li>Model filter where you can add exceptions for elements which should have collisions enabled (useful for symmetrical objects)</li>

			                                            <li>All mirrored objects are double-sided and have disabled collisions by default (you can add exceptions and enable collisions for symmetrical objects, watch video for more info). It is because many objects are assymetrical and a special shader is needed.</li>
			                                            <li>All mirrored objects have disabled alpha animation when they appear because their draw distance is about 5-10% worse than normal objects (due to MTA bug/limitation). More info in the video.</li>
			                                            <li>Tool can mirror most of popular element types: object, vehicle, ped, marker, race pickup, race spawnpoint.</li>
			                                            <li>Cloning mirrored elements is possible in both ways as a group or a single element.</li>

			                                            <li>Will lose that effect if any property is edited in object properties (keep in mind that object property ≠ group property and also if you really want to edit property of a single object you can use 'Add mirror effect' button to recover mirror effect)</li>
			                                            <li>Cannot be mirrored twice. Technically you can do it but it won't be mirrored properly as long as the object isn't symmetrical.</li>

							<li>Added duplicate 2.0:</li>
							<ul>
							<li>Added option of duplicating single elements, not only groups. You can also mix it and duplicate groups and single element alternately</li>
							<li>Added 'Linear' option which blocks rotation change (duplicated elements have the same rotation as their parents)</li>
							<li>Added elements preview</li>
							<li>Improved duplicating with 'Between' option - now elements are created alternately (in version 1.0 only 1st selection was duplicated)</li>
							<li>Duplicate tool is now hidden in sub-window with slightly changed GUI. Press duplicate image icon to use this tool</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Added option of covering single elements</li>
							<li>Fixed cover preview sometimes shows wrong objects</li>
							<li>Cover preview is now visible even while creating a group (red objects). Same goes to new mirror feature</li>
							<li>Interface is more clear now</li>
							<li>'Wand options' button is now hidden until you select Wand selection</li>
							<li>Added info about image buttons in main interface (when they are selected)</li>
							<li>Added setting which changes sensivity of rotation movement. It applies to normal movement (slow & fast movement don't change). It is primarily useful when you want to rotate by 45/90 degrees way faster (this way of rotation change is much better than in group properties).</li>
							<li>Effect of changing object's doubleside property is now visible. But keep in mind that map editor always makes objects doublesided so after next map loading this effect will be visible only while testing. Same goes to collisions.</li>
							<li>Overall improvements and bug fixes</li>
